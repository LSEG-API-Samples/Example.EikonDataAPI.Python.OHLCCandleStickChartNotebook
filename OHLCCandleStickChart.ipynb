    "# Generate CandleStick Chart using TimeSeries data from LSEG Data Library for Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, [LSEG Data Library for Python](https://developers.lseg.com/en/api-catalog/lseg-data-platform/lseg-data-library-for-python) provides the functionality to request a historical data so users can use the data for fundamental historical data analysis or technical analysis. They can also use the data to illustrate market movements. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Japanese candlestick chart and open-high-low-close chart (also OHLC) commonly used to illustrate movements in the price of a financial instrument over time. It's popular in finance and some strategies in technical analysis use them to make trading decisions, depending on the shape, color, and position of the candles. Although the Eikon user can use this kind of chart on Eikon Desktop, the API is a choice for a user who wants to use their own algorithm and calculation to generate a graph for technical analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example demonstrates how to request the Time Series data from [LSEG Data Library for Python](https://developers.lseg.com/en/api-catalog/lseg-data-platform/lseg-data-library-for-python) and plot a simple graphs for basic technical analysis. And it also provide sample codes to generate an OHLC CandleStick chart and then plotting a Moving average to the graph. The user can use their own algorithm to make a decision based on the result from the graph and OHLC CandleStick chart. Note that this example does not cover the part to analyze the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Packages Required\n",
    "\n",
    "User must [install LSEG Data Library for Python](https://developers.lseg.com/en/api-catalog/lseg-data-platform/lseg-data-library-for-python/quick-start#getting-started-with-python) and it requires __pandas__, __matplotlib__, __ipympl__, and __candlestick_ohlc__ from __mplfinance__ to process and visualize the stock data returned from the Eikon data API. We also use a method __histplot__ from __seaborn__ package to plot a histogram to see a distribution of the price.\n",
